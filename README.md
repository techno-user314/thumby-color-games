# Thumby Color games
Video games that I have made for the Thumby Color by [TinyCircuits](https://tinycircuits.com/).

## Installation
Just copy the selected game folder onto your Thumby Color and enjoy!  

Game instructions are included in a README in the game folders.

## Hopefully coming in the near future:
- Frogger - Infinity Mode
- Astroids (yes, the 1980's game by Atari)
- Ports of some games from the original Thumby
