A simple game, where the goal is to turn the entire board red.

Upon launching the game, you will be presented with a menu, where you can use the +pad to select the game settings.  
- Up/Down changes the amount of initial mixing
- Left/Right changes the depth of the mixing
- Press A to start the game

The game is played on an 8x8 grid of colored tiles, and gameplay revolves around the "swap". The player can select a tile and perform a "swap" on it by pressing the A button (pressing B will perform a reverse swap). When a swap is played every tile within 1 space of the selected tile (diagonals included) changes color. The color it changes to depends on what color it was previously, and the depth selected before the game begins. The depth determines how many colors are possible to swap to.  
  
For example, during a game with a depth of 3 selected, a swap would turn any nearby red tiles blue, any blue tiles green, and any green tiles red. The game starts by having the computer perform a certain number of initial swaps (determined in the menu before the game), and the player's goal is to turn the entire board red. The difficulty, of course, is that you can't affect only one tile at a time. You always affect a 3x3 section.  
  
After a couple playthroughs, you will begin to see some tricks that make the game pretty easy to solve most of the time.
